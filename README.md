# PetmergencyApp
Our application will have a user and a veterinary login option. Users will be able to select which
symptoms the animal is showing, the animal's approximate age and weight (if they can not estimate
there will be photographs to choose between). Users will be able to take and send photographs to
veterinary, see whether the veterinary has the necessary equipment and location information.
The veterinary will be able to answer to the emergency appeal, check whether they are available or not,
select the location radius of emergency notifications.
Additionally, users will see what they are or not supposed to do as a first aid.
